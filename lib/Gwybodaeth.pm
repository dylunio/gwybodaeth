=head1 NAME

Gwybodaeth - a set of classes and scripts to RDF-ize data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #This will load all the distributed Gwybodaeth modules:
    use Gwybodaeth;

    # Script inteface:
    gwybodaeth --src=data --map=map.N3 --in=input_data_type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The gwybodaeth collection of classes and scripts are aimed to help in the
RDF-izing of data. The modules provide an object orientated API and are
designed to be easily extended and customized.

Gwybodaeth's main features are:

=over 3

=item *

Ability to map data from an input into RDF.

=item *

Extendible so that more more input data types can be handled while using
gwybodaeth's mapping functionality.

=head1 CLASSES

The most important classes are in the C<Gwybodaeth::Parsers> and
C<Gwybodaeth::Write> namespaces. These are the classes which parse the input
format and write out the data in RDF according to the mapping.

=over 3

=item L<Gwybodaeth::Escape>

A class which provides escaping functionality for RDF/XML output.

=item L<Gwybodaeth::NamespaceManager>

A class which extracts and managed namespace information.

=item L<Gwybodaeth::Parsers::*>

Classes for parsing input data into data structures for use by the rest of
gwybodaeth based programs.

=item L<Gwybodaeth::Read>

A class for slurping data from either local files or over http.

=item L<Gwybodaeth::Tokenize>

A class for tokenizing data on white space.

=item L<Gwybodaeth::Triples>

A class which takes care of gwybodaeth's triples data structure.

=item L<Gwybodaeth::Write>

A class meant for subclassing to create bespoke map appliers for custom inputs.
It contains most of the map application logic.

=item L<Gwybodaeth::Write::*>

Classes based on C<Gwybodaeth::Write> which offer map application and writing to
different input types.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 USAGE

Applying a local map to a publically available CSV source:

gwybodaeth --src=http://www.example.org/data.csv --map=my_data_map.N3 --in=csv

Applying a local map to XML data from GeoNames:

gwybodaeth --source=http://ws.geonames.org/countryInfo?country=GB
--map=my_geo_map.N3 --in=geonames

=head2 MAPS

Maps are written in a dialect of N3 (L<http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3>). The maps generally correspond
to the maps in use by RDF123 (L<http://rdf123.umbc.edu/>).

This is an example of a simple mapping for a CSV file:

    @prefix rdf:     <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
    @prefix rdfs:    <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
    @prefix :        <#> .

    [] a rdf:Description ;
       rdfs:seeAlso "Ex:$1" . 

For every row of the CSV file it will create a triple:

    rdf:Description => rdfs:seeAlso => Ex:$1

where Ex:$1 will be replaced by the content of the first column of the row.
